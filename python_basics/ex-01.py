# Write a Python program that:
#
# asks the user for their first name,
# asks the user for their last name,
# prints a message that says something like:
#   ‘Nice to meet you, <first_name> <last_name>.’
#
#
# To convert a line to a comment - CTRL+/ (toggle line as a comment)

given_name = input("What is your first name: ")

# duplicate current line (or selection) CTRL+D
family_name = input("What is your last name: ")

print(f"nice to meet you {given_name} {family_name}")
